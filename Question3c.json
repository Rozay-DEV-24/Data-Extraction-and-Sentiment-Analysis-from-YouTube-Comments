And that&#39;s great! But it belies his message in these movies. Heck, one <i>easy</i> way to say &quot;There&#39;s Good In Human Tech, Too,&quot; would have been to have the ability to explore the bottom of the ocean for longer be something the Na&#39;vi were jealous of Spider for. Make Spider&#39;s survival tech BETTER for exploring than the Na&#39;vi natural talents, on the basis taht it already is helping him survive their world. This would even let him keep his &quot;heroic humans&quot; distinct from his &quot;wicked humans,&quot; since Spider appreciates Na&#39;vi society."

He made zero effort to inform them of what the humans wanted, and why, nor to negotiate a way to get it without causing problems for the Na&#39;vi. He didn&#39;t even warn them of it, let alone suggest ways they could work together or trade or what-have-you. He did NOTHING he was supposed to do.<br><br>And the corporate dudes failed utterly to listen to their science advisors, and their science advisors didn&#39;t try to explain anything before whining about not being listened to. Nobody acted like the kind of person who would last 5 days into a training seminar for the first round of candidate trials to go on a super-expensive mission like this one. <br><br>And all of that is to make sure the plot goes into the toilet so that we can have the hackneyed &quot;humans and corporations bad; nature and magic plants good&quot; message, which doesn&#39;t even land very well because to MAKE the nature-good thing have any weight, they had to give a magic psychic bond to all natives of the planet, which isn&#39;t present on Earth in a way that lets the message translate. &quot;If you all could snap your fingers and make food, then there would be no world hunger!&quot; is the same level of messaging about &quot;greed bad, feeding people good.&quot;<br><br>Ironically, I think the second movie has more interesting plots, but would&#39;ve been better served as a miniseries. The coming-of-age story coupled to the stranger-in-a-strange-land story that contrasts Na&#39;vi cultural differences between each other with human need to adapt to the planet and new cultures was actually pretty cool."

I am not arguing that the Avatar movies are some sort of masterpieces storytelling-wise - they are not. They actually are lazy and superficial in terms of the plot. BUT. You are failing to do, what you are critiquing here: to set your personal ideology aside. What it sounds like to me is that you feel offended by the point and critique the films are making - like many other people if you start talking to them about e.g. the climate crisis or their meat consumption. People don\u2019t want to have their warped versions of realy challagend or to give up their way of life, even though it is proven to destroy our very own basis of existence as a species (and not &quot;just&quot; the \u201ebeauty of nature\u201c) and react emotionally and try to shift the blame or to proof, why their way of life in reality is fine (even though it is not) - especially by trying to pick apart the person who is stating the opposite point by trying to find faults in them. Because if they are not morally impeccable, then you don\u2019t have to listen to what they are stating, even if what they are stating are undeniable facts. Right? You can stay in denial and don\u2019t have to feel responsible or, shocker, feel obligated to actually do something about it. This is what you are doing here. What is your point\u2026? That the movie is demonising the system, that is responsible for the destruction of our ecosystem and therefor for unmeasurable suffering that is already happening and of what is way more to come in the next years? To stay with the picture this word is painting: so, you are mad that the movie demonises the demon\u2026? Just because it is not a perfect movie? Well. The cognitive dissonance seems to be strong with this one, eh."
